## Results

### Outcomes
The following conclusion can be made by looking at the graphs below
![Checkout_times](https://github.com/dianavillarreall/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout%20times.png)
* Most trips last less than half an hour with the longest ones being only an hour long, this shows that it would be more convenient to charge per the minute instead fo the hour.
![Checkout_by_gender](https://github.com/dianavillarreall/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Checkout_by_gender.png)
* Women and mens rides last about the same amount of time, here you can also see the difference between genders on the amount of rides they make.
![Weekday_per_hour](https://github.com/dianavillarreall/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/weekday_per_hour.png)
* The optimal times for rentals are around 7am to 9 am and 5pm to 7 pm and, the bisiest days for the business are during weekdays, this helps us to know the supply of bicycles that will be needed at that time and also that more than likely target customer will be people going and getting out of work. 
![Trips_by_gender](https://github.com/dianavillarreall/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/trips_by_gender.png)
* You can see how the utilization of the service is very similar for both genders and also the unrefusable gap of cutomers between males and females
![Gender_by_Weekday](https://github.com/dianavillarreall/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/gender_by_weekday.png)
* Once again, you can see how males are more likely to utilize the service rather than females but also you can see how Thursdays and Fridays are the busiest days out of the week. 
![Starting_Location](https://github.com/dianavillarreall/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/starting_locations.png)
* The most popular locations where customers start aquiring the service is right at the center of the city and also the coast.
![Ending_locations](https://github.com/dianavillarreall/bikesharing/blob/main/Resources/Ending_locations.png)
* Most ending locations for customer are right in the center of the city, from this we can deduct that they are visiting areas where tourism is very high and more than likely don't want bother walking and pushing around people.

## Summary
Bicicle rentals should be a great investment especially in a place like New York City were a lot of residents usually don't own a car and tourist are always looking fo an easier way to travel aorund. Since it looks like females are still not very fond of the service, there should be more marketing directed to women since they might not know the benefits of requesting this product, it should also be advertised for tourists with posibly adding a map to the bicicle with all the places you could visit using you bicycle. Inveting in this business will benefit everyone involved as it is someone people will always be looking for.
